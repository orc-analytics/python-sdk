## [unreleased]

## [v0.13.0] - 25-01-2026

## Added

- The primitives to add lookbacks to dependency results

## Changed

- Improved how dependency results are served within the algorithm

## [v0.12.0] - 03-01-2026

### Removed

- The `registry` stub. Not needed as the CLI will now create direct source code that lives in the local processors repository.

## [v0.11.0] - 02-01-2026

### Added
- A stubbed out `registry` module within the package that the Orca CLI generates type stubs for.
    This module will contain the algorithms, window types and metadata present within Orca core.
    The LSP that the user uses must be pointed towards the stubs generated from the CLI for this
    to be effective - typically via the `stubs` argument.

## [v0.10.0] - 27-09-2025
- Bumped Orca version

## [v0.9.0] - 27-09-2025

### Changed

- How the processor address is provided to combine address and port, with a robust regex handling of the address.

### Added

- Additional optional env var to register with Orca core a different port to what is exposed internally


## [v0.8.0] - 23-09-2025

### Added

- Integrated support for more robust metadata handling
